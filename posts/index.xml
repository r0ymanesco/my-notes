      <description>Rate distortion interpretation Rate-distortion theory is described in detail here . An example of this can be seen in the project DeepJSCC Stream . Specifically, the approach where a conditional transformer is used to predict the number of channel uses needed to achieve a certain reconstruction quality is exactly a rate-distortion problem.
Relationship to text-to-image generators There seems to be a connection between semantics and text-to-image generators. Clearly the semantic of the text and image are being matched to generate images that match the description of the text.</description>

      <description>Rate-distortion This is fairly straight forward, will complete later.
Universal coding Universal coding is concerned with meeting a distortion constraint when the source distribution \(p\) is unknown. A coding scheme is said to be universal over a class of source distributions if the rate redundancy converges to zero for every source in that class.
d-semifaithful coding \(d\)-semifaithful coding is a form of lossy compression in which the decoder outputs a reconstruction sequence that is within distortion \(d\) of the original source sequence with probability 1.</description>
