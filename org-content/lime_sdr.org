* Move away from GNURadio
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lime_sdr_a
:END:
GNURadio is too hard to maintain.
It has too many dependencies and is hard to write modules for.
It would be better to simplify to just a Python script with SoapySDR interfaces.
* Rust implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lime_sdr_b
:END:
The SoapySDR C++ library has Rust bindings, which can be used to set the LimeSDR parameters.
Rust should provide much better efficiency compared to Python, although Python might be easier to for experimentation.
A small proof-of-concept project that uses the Rust bindings to send a singletone sinusoid is [[https://github.com/r0ymanesco/rust-singletone][completed]].
